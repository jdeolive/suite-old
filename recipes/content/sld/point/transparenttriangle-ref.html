        <h1>Transparent Triangle Documentation</h1>
        <div class="description">
This example draws a triangle, creates a black stroke identical to the Simple point with stroke example, and sets the fill of the triangle to 20% opacity (mostly transparent).</div>
        <div class="content">
            In this example, <strong>line 11</strong> once again sets the shape, in this case to a triangle. <strong>Line 13</strong> sets the fill color to a dark green (#009900) and line 9 sets the opacity to 0.2 (20% opaque). An opacity value of 1 means that the shape is drawn 100% opaque, while an opacity value of 0 means that the shape is drawn 0% opaque, or completely transparent. The value of 0.2 (20% opaque) means that the fill of the points partially takes on the color and style of whatever is drawn beneath it. In this example, since the background is white, the dark green looks lighter. Were the points imposed on a dark background, the resulting color would be darker. <strong>Lines 17-18</strong> set the stroke color to black (#000000) and width to 2 pixels. Finally, <strong>line 21</strong> sets the size of the point to be 12 pixels in diameter.
