        <h1>Transparent Polygon</h1>
        <div class="description">
            This example builds on the Simple polygon with stroke example and makes the fill partially transparent by setting the opacity to 50%.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            This example is similar to the Polygon with Stroke example, save for defining the fill's opacity in <strong>line 11</strong>. The value of 0.5 results in partially transparent fill that is 50% opaque. An opacity value of 1 would draw the fill as 100% opaque, while an opacity value of 0 would result in a completely transparent (0% opaque) fill. In this example, since the background is white, the dark blue looks lighter. Were the points imposed on a dark background, the resulting color would be darker.
