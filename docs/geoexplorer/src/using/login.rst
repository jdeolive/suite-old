.. _geoexplorer.using.login:Login=====GeoExplorer can connect to many different types of data sources for read-only access.  In addition to this, when a local GeoServer is present, GeoExplorer can connect to that GeoServer for full read/write capabilities..  Specifically, this means that GeoExplorer can:* :ref:`Create and delete features <geoexplorer.using.createfeature>`* :ref:`Edit existing features <geoexplorer.using.editfeature>`* :ref:`Edit styling of map layers <geoexplorer.using.style>`* :ref:`Upload data to GeoServer <geoexplorer.using.upload>`For security reasons, before editing capabilities are enabled, GeoExplorer needs to authenticate with GeoServer.Authentication--------------To connect to your local GeoServer for read/write access#. Ensure that GeoServer exists in the same servlet container.  For example, if your GeoExplorer is at ``http://example.com/geoexplorer``, you will only be able to login to a GeoServer located at ``http://example.com/geoserver``.#. Click on the :guilabel:`Login` button.  This button is on the top right of the window, on the very right side of the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.toolbar`.   .. figure:: images/login_button.png      :align: center      *Login button*#. Enter the administrator credentials for GeoServer.  This is the same username and password that gives full access to the GeoServer web admin interface.   .. note:: The default username and password is ``admin / geoserver``.   .. figure:: images/login_filled.png      :align: center      *Entering the administration credentials for GeoServer*If credentials are entered correctly, the login button will disappear.  Other ways to tell that you are logged in are that the editing buttons (specifically :ref:`geoexplorer.using.createfeature` and :ref:`geoexplorer.using.editfeature`) will become enabled when selecting a local layer in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel`, and the :guilabel:`Upload Data` button will appear in the :ref:`geoexplorer.using.add` dialog.Login FAQ---------The following are common questions asked when using the authentication feature of GeoExplorer.*Can I log in to or edit other servers other than GeoServer?*  No, GeoExplorer only supports login to GeoServer.  However, GeoExplorer can connect to and read from a variety of sources.

However, if using a the community version of GeoServer, please ensure that you are using version GeoServer 2.1.0 or newer.*Can I log in to and edit a remote GeoServer?*  No, only the local GeoServer are supported.  GeoServer needs to be in the same web application container as GeoExplorer.
