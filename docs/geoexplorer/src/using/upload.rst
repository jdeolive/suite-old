.. _geoexplorer.using.upload:Upload Data===========GeoExplorer has the ability to upload data directly into a local instance of GeoServer (served from the same servlet container).  You can upload any archived shapefile (compressed into a zip/tar/gzip/bzip archive) or a GeoTIFF, and the data will automatically be configured and styled to work in GeoExplorer... warning:: Shapefiles must be in an archive.  Just selecting a file with a ``.shp`` extension will not work.  See the section on :ref:`geoexplorer.using.upload.formats` for more information.To access the Upload Data interface, open the :guilabel:`Add Layers` dialog in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerstoolbar`... note:: See the :ref:`geoexplorer.using.add` section for more information about adding layers... figure:: images/add_button.png   :align: center   *Add Layers button in the Layers toolbar*.. figure:: images/add_dialog.png   :align: center   *Add Layers dialog with Upload Data button*.. note:: You may be asked to authenticate aginst GeoServer.  Please enter an administrative username and password to continue.The Add Layers dialog will display.  If authenticated correctly, you will see an :guilabel:`Upload Data` button in the bottom left of the dialog.  Click this button to bring up the Upload Data dialog. .. figure:: images/upload_dialog.png   :align: center   *Upload Data dialog*Fill out the form.  .. list-table::     :header-rows: 1     :widths: 20 80     * - Field       - Description     * - Title       - The Title of the layer.  This field is designed to be human-readable (as opposed to the ID/Name).  If left blank, the Title will be set to ``[workspace]:[basefilename]``.     * - Description       - The Abstract for the layer.  This field can be a long description (multiple paragraphs) if desired.     * - Data       - The file to be uploaded.  Valid file extensions are ``.zip``, ``.gz``, ``.tar.bz2``, ``.tar``, ``.tgz``, ``.tbz2``, or ``.tif``.  Click the folder icon to bring up a file chooser.  See the section on :ref:`geoexplorer.using.upload.formats` for more information on what can be uploaded.The form also has an :guilabel:`Options` check box that brings up two additional options.  .. list-table::     :header-rows: 1     :widths: 20 80     * - Field       - Description     * - Workspace       - The GeoServer workspace to be associated with the layer.  Select from any available workspaces.  Default is the default workspace in GeoServer.       * - Store       - The GeoServer store where the layer will be stored.  Select from any available store.  Default is the default store in GeoServer.  .. figure:: images/upload_dialogfilled.png   :align: center   *Upload Data dialog with a shapefile archive*When the form is filled out, click :guilabel:`Upload`.  The contents of the file will be parsed, and the following actions will occur:* File copied to the GeoServer data directory (in a subfolder named :guilabel:`incoming`).* Archive unpacked (if applicable)* Data set loaded as a layer in GeoServer (with Title and Description set as per the form contents).* Projection for the layer will be determined if possible (otherwise this information will need to be supplied separately to GeoServer)* Unique style created for the layer.. figure:: images/upload_progressbar.png   :align: center   *Uploading and configuring data*After the process is complete, you will see your new layers populated in the :guilabel:`Available layers` dialog, where you can now `add <geoexplorer.useing.add>`_ them to your map... _geoexplorer.using.upload.formats:Data formats------------The upload dialog will accept as input data in either shapefile or GeoTIFF format.  If uploading shapefile data, the data must be converted into archive form (zip/tar/gzip/bzip).  This is because the form requires a single file to use in the upload process, and shapefiles by definition are split over more than one file (at a minimum, ``.shp``, ``.shx``, and ``.dbf``).A GeoTIFF (``.tif``) does not need to be contained in an archive, but can be if desired.
