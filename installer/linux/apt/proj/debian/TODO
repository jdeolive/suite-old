Maintainers TODO list
---------------------

The tarball contains a jniwrap section. It would be nice to enable that section after java-in-main.
Please see Java Policy and find if it needs to depen on Sun Java or what else.

The proj-data package is non endianess-aware due to the simple binary format produced by nad2bin.
The lla -> bin conversion should be done in postinst and the proj-data converted in a
binary all package.
