      Learn how to build applications with the OpenGeo Suite!

    <div class="content">

      <p>This site contains code samples (or "recipes") that provide direction on how to use The OpenGeo Suite.  They are designed as discrete pieces of functionality, to be starting points for creating your own map application.  Each recipe is a working example of some functionality of the OpenGeo Suite.  </p>

      <p>Each recipe will provide three tabs:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Demo</strong>, which contains the final map output</li>
          <li><strong>Source</strong>, which displays the HTML and JavaScript source code of the map</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation</strong>, which gives a brief text description, as well as relevant links to API documentation</li>
        </ul></p>

      <p>While some recipes only make use of one component of the OpenGeo Suite, many rely on various parts working together.  For example, the <a href="../#basic/map" target=_blank>Basic Map</a> creates an OpenLayers map based on a layer served through GeoWebCache.  Use the <strong>Search</strong> tab to find relevant code to use in your applications.  You can filter by keyword and by component.</p>

      <p>For further information about the components of the OpenGeo Suite, please see the <a href="../../docs" target=_blank>full documentation</a> for each component.  OpenGeo also offers training classes as part of our Enterprise Edition packages, and they are open to the public as well.  In the future we plan to include workshop material as part of the OpenGeo Suite.  For now, we have material available at the OpenGeo <a href="http://workshops.opengeo.org" target=_blank>Education Center</a>.</p>
