postgis (1.4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
  * Updated configure arguments now obsolete/changed.

    reflected in debian/control for safety.

    required. Now the .in template for postrm changed for multiversioning.
  * Now build-dep on default-jdk which is DFSG-safe.
  * Removed Fabio Tranchitella among Uploaders because retired from DebianGis.

  * Added Vcs-* fields in debian/control.
  * Fixed download URL in debian/copyright.

    hard link in the postgres library path at configure time. That would
    allow coexistence of different flavors of the library which could be
    used by different DBs at run-time and allowing soft/hard-upgrade scripts
    working. (closes: #441794, #441797)

      to, unnecessary and potentially dangerous)
    * Dropped support for 7.4, after discussion with Martin Pitt and others
      it's clear that there isn't any need for a 7.4 version of PostGIS in
      etch.
    * New upstream release Closes: #311732
