.. _geoexplorer.using.measure:Measure Tool============The :guilabel:`Measure` tool will find the area or length of a section of the map.  To activate this tool, click the :guilabel:`Measure` button in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.toolbar`.  There are two options for this tool, selected by a drop-down button list:  Length, for one dimensional measurements, and Area, for two dimensional measurements... figure:: images/measure_button.png   :align: center   *Measure tool button with drop down*Length------The Measure Length tool allows you to measure in one dimension directly on the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`.  The measurement is the sum of a series of one or more line segments or curves.To initiate the measurement, click on the map.  As you move the mouse away from that point, a dashed line will extend from the initial point.  Click elsewhere to create a second point.  The current length will be displayed (in both kilometers and miles).  To continue the measurement, click additional points on the map.  The length will be a running total of the line segments.  When finished, double click on the map and the final measurement will be displayed.  Close the pop-up that displays the length to erase the line... figure:: images/measure_lengthline.png   :align: center   *Length measurement with line segments*If straight line segments are not desired, measurement of curves is possible via freehand drawing.  To activate freehand drawing, hold the Shift key while clicking, holding, and moving the mouse around the map.  The dashed line will follow the mouse movements.  It is also possible to combine line segments and freehand drawing in the same measurement... figure:: images/measure_lengthcurve.png   :align: center   *Length measurement with a curve*Area----The Measure Area tool allows you to measure in two dimensions directly on the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`.  The resulting measurement is the area of a polygon made up of a series of one or more line segments or curves.To initiate the measurement, click on the map.  As you move the mouse away from that point, a solid line will extend from the initial point.  Click again to create a second point.  These points will becomes the vertices of the polygon which will be measured.  To continue the measurement, click additional points on the map.   After three vertices have been added to the map, The current area will be displayed (in both square kilometers and square miles).  When finished, double click on the map and the final measurement will be displayed.  Close the pop-up that displays the length to erase the polygon... figure:: images/measure_areapolygon.png   :align: center   *Area measurement with a polygon*If straight line segments are not desired, measurement of curves is possible via freehand drawing.  To activate freehand drawing, hold the Shift key while clicking, holding, and moving the mouse around the map.  The solid line will follow the mouse movements.  It is also possible to combine line segments and freehand drawing in the same measurement... figure:: images/measure_areacurve.png   :align: center   *Area measurement with a curve*
