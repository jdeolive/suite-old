Quickly assemble maps from GeoServer or any :term:`OGC` Web Mapping Server (:term:`WMS`) and integrate with hosted maps such as Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.  Edit map styling information graphically.  Embed composed maps in any web page and output them in PDF format.

GeoExplorer is based on the :term:`GeoExt` framework and is built using :term:`GXP` components.
