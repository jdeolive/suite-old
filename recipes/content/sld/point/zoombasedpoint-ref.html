        <h1>Zoom-based Point Documentation</h1>
        <div class="description">
            This example alters the style of the points at different zoom levels.        
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It is often desirable to make shapes larger at higher zoom levels when creating a natural-looking map. This example styles the points to vary in size based on the zoom level (or more accurately, scale denominator). Scale denominators refer to the scale of the map. A scale denominator of 10,000 means the map has a scale of 1:10,000 in the units of the map projection.</p>            
            <p>Note Determining the appropriate scale denominators (zoom levels) to use is beyond the scope of this example.</p>            
            <p>This style contains three rules. The three rules are designed as follows:</p>            
            <table class="reference">
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Rule order</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Rule name / type</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Scale denominator</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Point size</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Large</td>
                <td>1:160,000,000 or less</td>
                <td>12</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td>1:160,000,000 to 1:320,000,000</td>
                <td>8</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Small</td>
                <td>Greater than 1:320,000,000</td>
                <td>4</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            The order of these rules does not matter since the scales denominated in each rule do not overlap.
            <p>The first rule (<strong>lines 7-21</strong>) is for the smallest scale denominator, corresponding to when the view is "zoomed in". The scale rule is set on <strong>line 9</strong>, so that the rule will apply to any map with a scale denominator of 160,000,000 or less. The rule draws a circle (<strong>line 13</strong>), colored red (#CC3300 on <strong>line 15</strong>) with a size of 12 pixels (<strong>line 18</strong>).</p>
            <p>The second rule (<strong>lines 22-37</strong>) is the intermediate scale denominator, corresponding to when the view is "partially zoomed". The scale rules are set on <strong>lines 24-25</strong>, so that the rule will apply to any map with a scale denominator between 160,000,000 and 320,000,000. (The <tt>&lt;MinScaleDenominator&gt;</tt> is inclusive and the <tt>&lt;MaxScaleDenominator&gt;</tt> is exclusive, so a zoom level of exactly 320,000,000 would not apply here.) Aside from the scale, the only difference between this rule and the first is the size of the symbol, which is set to 8 pixels on <strong>line 34</strong>.</p>
              <p>The third rule (<strong>lines 38-52</strong>) is the largest scale denominator, corresponding to when the map is "zoomed out". The scale rule is set on <strong>line 40</strong>, so that the rule will apply to any map with a scale denominator of 320,000,000 or more. Again, the only other difference between this rule and the others is the size of the symbol, which is set to 4 pixels on <strong>line 49</strong>.</p>
              <p>The result of this style is that points are drawn larger as one zooms in and smaller as one zooms out.</p>
