= GeoExt 0.6 Release Notes =

This release of GeoExt includes many new widgets and data components. These
notes summarize the new features and list bug fixes included since the last
release.

== Dependencies ==
 * Ext JS >= 2.2
 * OpenLayers >= 2.8 (see notes below about features that require higher than 2.8)

GeoExt 0.6 was tested with Ext JS 2.2.1 and OpenLayers revision 9737.

== Overview Of GeoExt 0.6 Features ==

=== Widgets ===

 * New [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/tree.html LayerParamNode]
   added. This lets you configure your layer tree to display one node for each
   layer listed in the LAYERS (or any other) parameter of a WMS request. You can
   use the same to display one layer node for each of any entry in a parameter
   list.

 * New [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/feature-grid.html FeatureSelectionModel] 
   added. This allows you to bind selection in a grid with feature records to
   feature selection on a layer.

 * New [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/layeropacityslider.html sliders] 
   to adjust layer opacity.

 * The [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/layercontainer.html LayerContainer] 
   widget got a couple enhancements for better drag/drop support and flexibility
   in configuring child nodes.

 * Layer nodes can now be rendered with a radio input instead of a checkbox.
   This gives you exclusive visibility for layers in the same group.

 * Many [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/legendpanel.html LegendPanel] 
   enhancements including support for refreshing the legend when layer
   parameters change, deriving the legend URL from capabilities documents, and
   providing a filter to limit layers shown in the legend.

=== Data Components ===

 * New WFSCapabilitiesStore and WFSCapabilitiesReader added. This store and
   associated reader handle WFS capabilities responses, creating a store of
   vector layer records.

 * New WMSDescribeLayerStore and WMSDescribeLayerReader added.  These can be used
   to generate and store records representing WMS layer attributes advertised in
   WMS DescribeLayer documents.

 * New [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/attributes.html AttributeStore and AttributeReader]. 
   This store can be used to represent feature attributes (derived from
   DescribeFeatureType responses for example).

 * New WMCReader added. This reader creates layer records based on Web Map
   Context documents.

 * More features for the
   [http://dev.geoext.org/trunk/geoext/examples/wms-capabilities.html WMSCapabilitiesReader].
   Layers derived from the reader now get attribution metadata and can be
   created with user supplied options. The reader can also take advantage of
   additional elements parsed by the OpenLayers format for applications using
   the latest from the OpenLayers trunk.

== Bug fixes ==

=== GeoExt.tree.LayerNode ===

 * Radio buttons on tree nodes are no longer unchecked at the start of a drag
   (#112). 

 * LayerNode no longer changes defaults on the node UI (#114).

 * Layer node text no longer updated if provided in the node config (#110).

=== GeoExt.data.LayerContainer ===

 * Overlay and base layer containers now call superclasses with correct
   arguments (#111).

=== GeoExt.data.WMSCapabilitiesReader ===

 * Test improvements (#105).
 
 * Reader now respects fields from configuration (#157).
 
 * Reader still works with OpenLayers 2.8 (#162).

=== GeoExt.data.FeatureStore ===

 * Several FeatureStore fixes related to editing and Ext 3.0 (#132, #134, #142,
   #143).

=== GeoExt.data.FeatureReader ===

 * Only calls convert when convert available (#159).

=== GeoExt.data.AttributeStore ===

 * Now can be constructed with no arguments (#136).

=== GeoExt.ZoomSlider ===

 * No longer fails when update called early (#148).

=== GeoExt.LegendWMS ===

 * Fixes for capabilities without style (#140) and proper use of STYLE (#163).

== OpenLayers Compatibility ==

This release includes several new features that take advantage of functionality
added to OpenLayers after the 2.8 release. If you previously used GeoExt 0.5 in
your application, you should be able to upgrade to GeoExt 0.6 and use OpenLayers
2.8 without any trouble. However, if you wish to take advantage of some of the
new features in GeoExt 0.6, you will need to use a more recent OpenLayers build
than the 2.8 release.

=== Features that require more than OpenLayers 2.8 ===

 * The WMSCapabilitiesReader supports enhancements to the WMSCapabilities format
   in OpenLayers (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9664).  The reader can be 
   used without these enhancements.

 * The WMCReader depends on changes to the WMC format in OpenLayers
   (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9733).

 * The WFSCapabilitiesReader depends on changes to the WFSCapabilities format in
   OpenLayers (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9658).

 * The DescribeLayerReader depends on changes to the DescribeLayer format in
   OpenLayers (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9570).

 * The refreshing legend panel depends on changes to HTTPRequest layers in
   OpenLayers (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9618).

 * The LayerOpacitySlider depends on changes to the map and layer in OpenLayers
   (http://trac.openlayers.org/changeset/9616).
