This example styles each point as a graphic instead of as a simple shape.</div>
        <div class="content">
            This style uses a graphic instead of a simple shape to render the points. In SLD, this is known as an <tt>&lt;ExternalGraphic&gt;</tt>, to distinguish it from the commonly-used shapes such as squares and circles that are internal to the renderer. <strong>Lines 10-15</strong> specify the details of this graphic. <strong>Line 13</strong> sets the path and file name of the graphic, while <strong>line 9</strong> indicates the format (MIME type) of the graphic (image/png). In this example, the graphic is contained in the same directory as the SLD, so no path information is necessary in <strong>line 13</strong>, although a full URL could be used if desired. <strong>Line 16</strong> determines the size of the displayed graphic; this can be set independently of the dimensions of the graphic itself, although in this case they are the same (32 pixels). Should a graphic be rectangular, the &lt;Size&gt; value will apply to the height of the graphic only, with the width scaled proportionally.
