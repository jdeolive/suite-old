.. _geoexplorer.using.add:Add Layers==========The first step when using GeoExplorer is to add layers.Click on the :guilabel:`Add Layers` button in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel` to display the :guilabel:`Available Layers` dialog, where you can select the layers you wish to add to GeoExplorer... figure:: images/add_button.png   :align: center   *Add Layers button in the Layers Panel toolbar*.. figure:: images/add_dialog.png   :align: center   *Add Layers dialog*This dialog shows all of the layers served through your local instance of GeoServer.  (If running GeoExplorer as a standalone module, GeoExplorer will instead display layers from a remote GeoServer by default.)  For each layer, the layer :guilabel:`Title` and :guilabel:`Id` is displayed.  The layer :guilabel:`Abstract` (description) for a given layer can be displayed by clicking on the plus icon next to that layer... figure:: images/add_abstract.png   :align: center   *Displaying the Abstract for a layer*.. note:: You can upload your own data directly through this dialog.  See the :ref:`geoexplorer.using.upload` section to learn more.Select layers by clicking them.  Shift-clicking will select multiple contiguous layers, while Ctrl/Cmd-clicking will select multiple non-contiguous layers.  Click the :guilabel:`Add Layers` button to add those layers to the map.  When done, click :guilabel:`Done`.  You should now see your layers in the Overlays folder in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel`... figure:: images/add_layersadded.png   :align: center   *Layers added to the map as overlays*GeoExplorer doesn't automatically zoom to your newly added layers.  If you don't see your layers in the Map Window, select a layer in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.layerspanel`, then and click the :guilabel:`Zoom to layer extent` button in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.toolbar`.  You can also right-click on a specific layer and select :guilabel:`Zoom to layer extent`.  In addition, you can manually zoom to the desired area by using the zoom and pan buttons in the :ref:`geoexplorer.workspace.mapwindow`.Default servers---------------GeoExplorer initially recognizes a number of servers, each with their own list of layers.    .. list-table::       :header-rows: 1       :widths: 20 40 40        * - Server Name         - Description         - Notes       * - **Local GeoServer**         - Local GeoServer WMS, if present on the same server as GeoExplorer.         - Not available when using the standalone version of GeoExplorer.       * - **Remote Suite GeoServer**         - GeoServer WMS on OpenGeo's servers.         - GeoServer URL is: ``http://v2.suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/``       * - **MapQuest Layers**         - Layers served through `MapQuest <http://mapquest.com>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`MapQuest OpenStreetMap`             * :guilabel:`MapQuest Imagery`       * - **OpenStreetMap Layers**         - Layers served through `OpenStreetMap <http://openstreetmap.org>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`Mapnik`             * :guilabel:`Tiles@Home`       * - **Google Layers**         - Layers served through `Google Maps <http://maps.google.com>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`Google Roadmap`             * :guilabel:`Google Satellite`             * :guilabel:`Google Hybrid`             * :guilabel:`Google Terrain`       * - **Bing Layers**         - Layers served through `Bing Maps <http://bing.com/maps>`_.         - Available layers:              * :guilabel:`Bing Roads`             * :guilabel:`Bing Aerial`             * :guilabel:`Bing Aerial with Labels`To view/add layers from one of these servers, select the server name from the :guilabel:`View available data from:` box... figure:: images/add_availableservers.png   :align: center   *Available servers*Connect to another WMS----------------------To load layers from a server not listed above, you will first need to add it to the list of available servers.  You can add any valid :term:`WMS`.To add a new server, click on :guilabel:`Add a New Server` in the :guilabel:`Available Layers` dialog box.  A small window will pop up, where a WMS service URL can be entered... figure:: images/add_newserver.png   :align: center   *Adding a new WMS server*You can enter a URL to a server's WMS endpoint or to a WMS :term:`GetCapabilities` request.  An example URL of a WMS endpoint would be::  http://suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/wmsAn example URL of a WMS GetCapabilities request would be::  http://suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms?service=wms&version=1.1.1&request=getcapabilitiesEither of the above URLs would result in the same list of layers.An example of a non-GeoServer WMS GetCapabilities request would::  http://terraservice.net/ogccapabilities.ashx?version=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilitiesOnce the server has been added to the list, any layers served from that server can be added to GeoExplorer as described above.
