        <h1>Zoom-based Polygon</h1>
        <div class="description">
             This example alters the style of the polygon at different zoom levels.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          It is often desirable to make shapes larger at higher zoom levels when creating a natural-looking map. This example varies the thickness of the lines according to the zoom level. Polygons already do this by nature of being two dimensional, but another way to adjust styling of polygons based on zoom level is to adjust the thickness of the stroke (to be larger as the map is zoomed in) or to limit labels to only certain zoom levels. This is ensures that the size and quantity of strokes and labels remains legible and doesn't overshadow the polygons themselves.

          <p>Zoom levels (or more accurately, scale denominators) refer to the scale of the map. A scale denominator of 10,000 means the map has a scale of 1:10,000 in the units of the map projection.</p>

          <p>Note: Determining the appropriate scale denominators (zoom levels) to use is beyond the scope of this example.</p>

          <p>This style contains three rules, defined as follows:</p>
          <table class="reference">
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Rule order</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Rule name / type</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Scale denominator</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Stroke width</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Label display?</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>Large</td>
              <td>1:100,000,000 or less</td>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>Medium</td>
              <td>1:100,000,000 to 1:200,000,000</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>Small</td>
              <td>Greater than 1:200,000,000</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>The first rule, on <strong>lines 7-41</strong>, is for the smallest scale denominator, corresponding to when the view is "zoomed in". The scale rule is set on <strong>line 12</strong> such that the rule will apply only where the scale denominator is 100,000,000 or less. <strong>Line 12</strong> defines the fill as blue (<tt>#0000CC</tt>). Note that the fill is kept constant across all rules regardless of the scale denominator. As in the Polygon with default label or Polygon with styled label examples, the rule also contains a <tt>&lt;TextSymbolizer&gt;</tt> at <strong>lines 19-40</strong> for drawing a text label on top of the polygon. <strong>Lines 24-27</strong> set the font information to be Arial, 14 pixels, and bold with no italics. The label is centered both horizontally and vertically along the centroid of the polygon on by setting <tt>&lt;AnchorPointX&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;AnchorPointY&gt;</tt> to both be 0.5 (or 50%) on <strong>lines 32-33</strong>. Finally, the color of the font is set to white (<tt>#FFFFFF</tt>) in <strong>line 38</strong>.</p>

          <p>The second rule, on <strong>lines 42-55</strong>, is for the intermediate scale denominators, corresponding to when the view is "partially zoomed". The scale rules on <strong>lines 44-45</strong> set the rule such that it will apply to any map with a scale denominator between 100,000,000 and 200,000,000. (The <tt>&lt;MinScaleDenominator&gt;</tt> is inclusive and the <tt>&lt;MaxScaleDenominator&gt;</tt> is exclusive, so a zoom level of exactly 200,000,000 would not apply here.) Aside from the scale, there are two differences between this rule and the first: the width of the stroke is set to 4 pixels on <strong>line 52</strong> and a <tt>&lt;TextSymbolizer&gt;</tt> is not present so that no labels will be displayed.</p>

          <p>The third rule, on <strong>lines 56-68</strong>, is for the largest scale denominator, corresponding to when the map is "zoomed out". The scale rule is set on <strong>line 58</strong> such that the rule will apply to any map with a scale denominator of 200,000,000 or greater. Again, the only differences between this rule and the others are the width of the lines, which is set to 1 pixel on <strong>line 65</strong>, and the absence of a <tt>&lt;TextSymbolizer&gt;</tt> so that no labels will be displayed.</p>

          <p>The resulting style produces a polygon stroke that gets larger as one zooms in and labels that only display when zoomed in to a sufficient level.</p>
