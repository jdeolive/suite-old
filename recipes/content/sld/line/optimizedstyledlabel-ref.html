        <h1>Optimized Styled Label</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example improves the style of optimally-placed labels
        </div>
        <div class="content">
           This example is similar to the Optimized label placement example. The only difference is in the font information, which is contained in <strong>lines 20-25</strong>. <strong>Line 21</strong> sets the font family to be "Arial", <strong>line 22</strong>  sets the font size to 10, <strong>line 23</strong> sets the font style to "normal" (as opposed to "italic" or "oblique"), and <strong>line 24</strong>  sets the font weight to "bold" (as opposed to "normal").</p>
           
           <p>Note: This example uses options that are specific to GeoServer and are not part of the SLD 1.0 specification.</p>
