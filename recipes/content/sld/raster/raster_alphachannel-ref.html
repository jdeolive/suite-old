        <h1>Raster Alpha Channel</h1>
        <div class="description">
          Create an "alpha channel" effect such that higher values are increasingly transparent.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          An alpha channel is another way of referring to variable transparency. Much like how a gradient maps values to colors, each entry in a <tt>&lt;ColorMap&gt;</tt> can have a value for opacity (with the default being 1.0 or completely opaque).

          In this example, there is a <tt>&lt;ColorMap&gt;</tt> with two entries: line 5 specifies the lower bound of 70 be colored dark green (<tt>#008000</tt>), while <strong>line 11</strong> specifies the upper bound of 256 also be colored dark green but with an opacity value of 0. This means that values of 256 will be rendered at 0% opacity (entirely transparent). Just like the gradient color, the opacity is also linearly interpolated such that a value of 163 (the midpoint between 70 and 256) is rendered at 50% opacity.
