        <h1>Label Following Line</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example renders the text label to follow the contour of the lines.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            As the Line with default label example showed, the default label behavior isn't very optimal. The label is displayed at a tangent to the line itself, leading to uncertainty as to which label corresponds to which line.

            <p>This example is similar to the Line with Default Label example with the exception of <strong>lines 20-23</strong>. <strong>Line 20</strong> sets the option to have the label follow the line, while <strong>lines 21-23</strong> specify that the label is placed along a line. If <tt>&lt;LinePlacement&gt;</tt> is not specified in an SLD, then <tt>&lt;PointPlacement&gt;</tt> is assumed, which isn't compatible with line-specific rendering options.</p>
            
            <p>Note: Labels following lines is an SLD extension specific to GeoServer. It is not part of the SLD 1.0 specification.</p>
