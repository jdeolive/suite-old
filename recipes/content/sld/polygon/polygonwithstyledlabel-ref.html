        <h1>Polygon with Styled Label</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example improves the label style from the Polygon with Default Label example by centering the label on the polygon, specifying a different font name and size, and setting additional label placement optimizations.        </div>
        <div class="content">
            This example is similar to the Polygon with Default Label example, with additional styling options within the <tt>&lt;TextSymbolizer&gt;</tt>  on <strong>lines 17-40</strong>. <strong>Lines 21-26</strong> set the font styling. <strong>Line 22</strong> sets the font family to be Arial, <strong>line 23</strong> sets the font size to 11 pixels, <strong>line 24</strong> sets the font style to "normal" (as opposed to "italic" or "oblique"), and <strong>line 25</strong> sets the font weight to "bold" (as opposed to "normal").

            <p>The <tt>&lt;LabelPlacement&gt;</tt> tag on <strong>lines 27-34</strong> affects where the label is placed relative to the centroid of the polygon. <strong>Line 30</strong> centers the label by positioning it 50% (or 0.5) of the way horizontally along the centroid of the polygon. <strong>Line 31</strong> centers the label vertically in exactly the same way.</p>

            <p>Finally, there are two added touches for label placement optimization: <strong>line 38</strong> ensures that long labels are split across multiple lines by setting line wrapping on the labels to 60 pixels, and <strong>line 39</strong> allows the label to be displaced by up to 150 pixels. This ensures that labels are compacted and less likely to spill over polygon boundaries. Notice little Massive County in the corner, whose label is now displayed.</p>
            
            <p>Note: The label placement optimizations discussed below (the <tt>&lt;VendorOption&gt;</tt> tags) are SLD extensions that are custom to GeoServer. They are not part of the SLD 1.0 specification.</p>
