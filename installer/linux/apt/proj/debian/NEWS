proj (4.6.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  Note that current package includes datum shifts which are traditionally
  distributed off the main tarball, and now maintained in a separate per arch
  proj-data package. Ssome of the enclosed files are arch independent
  and some other are not, because written as CTABLE structure. You need to use
  the nad2bin utility to regenerate those files starting from the distributed one
  if you wish, and the program must be run on the right target host.

  The original datum shifts are at the date of this program:

  http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.4.zip
  and chenyx06.zip for the Swiss NTv2 grid.

  Old packages did not contain the additional datum shifts due to an oversight
  and needed to be integrated with the lacking information in order to work 
  correctly with some projections and world areas (US, Canadian, French and 
  New Zealand).
  
  Note also that Canada distributes also its own better quality datum shifts 
  information in NTv2 format, but they are not re-distributable, so if you
  would use those information you are on your own.
