        <h1>Railroad Documentation</h1>
        <div class="description">
          This example uses hatching to create a railroad style. Both the line and the hatches are black, with a 2 pixel thickness for the main line and a 1 pixel width for the perpendicular hatches.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            In this example, there are two rules, each containing a <tt>&lt;LineSymbolizer&gt;</tt>. (Each <tt>&lt;LineSymbolizer&gt;</tt>  must exist in its own rule.) The first rule, on <strong>lines 7-13</strong>, draws a standard line, with <strong>line 10</strong> drawing the lines as dark gray (#333333) and <strong>line 11</strong> setting the width of the lines to be 2 pixels.

            <p>The hatching is invoked in the second rule, on <strong>lines 15-32</strong>. <strong>Line 21</strong> specifies that the rule draw a vertical line hatch (``shape://vertline``) perpendicular to the line geometry. <strong>Lines 23-24</strong> set the hatch color to dark gray (#333333) and width to 1 pixel. Finally, <strong>line 27</strong> specifies both the length of the hatch and the distance between each hatch to both be 12 pixels.</p>
            
            <p> Note: This example leverages an SLD extension in GeoServer. Hatching is not part of the standard SLD 1.0 specification.</p>
