Pending:

I forsee:

pg_start_server.sh
pg_stop_server.sh
postgis

all become part of the primary init script. (which i can do)

pg_config.sh
pg_initdb.sh
pg_install_data.sh
pg_install_template.sh
pg_install_user.sh
pg_passwd.sh

get rebuilt with a fixed location (/opt/pgsql) in mind.

Quite a few of these errors during the bundling process.. These look like items that should get fixed (they appear to all be items fixable during the initial make)


E: postgis: binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath ./opt/pgsql/lib/pageinspect.so /var/lib/hudson/buildroot/pgsql_build/lib
http://lintian.debian.org/tags/binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath.html suggests how to fix that.

Also

E: postgis: incorrect-libdir-in-la-file opt/pgsql/lib/libproj.la /var/lib/hudson/buildroot//proj/lib !=   /opt/pgsql/lib
http://lintian.debian.org/tags/incorrect-libdir-in-la-file.html

E: postgis: unstripped-binary-or-object ./opt/pgsql/lib/pageinspect.so

E: postgis: shlib-with-executable-bit opt/pgsql/lib/libwx_gtk2u_gizmos-2.8.so.0.7.0 0755

Running the suite through the package manager, the following changes are suggested.

Make .py and .sh executable (+x)
make .ini, .js, .jar NOT executable (-x)

make suite/jetty-start.jar 0755 (not 7777)
make suite/og-jetty.jar 0755 (not 7777)
make suite/opengeo-suite 0755 (not 0544)
make suite/version.ini 0644 (not 7777) 

To Build:
Get the source
unpack to a folder
copy the debian/ folder for the package into the source folder
use `debuild -uc -us` to build the deb

debian/control handles name and dependencies
debian/changelog handles version
debian/rules handles bundling procedure (file copies and bash-level commands)

rename these (remove .ex) to use
postinst.ex handles after files are installed (start services here)
postrm.ex  handles after files are removed (remove paths, users, etc)
preinst.ex  handles before files are installed (ie, create users and paths)
prerm.ex handles before files are removed (stop services)

buildpkg.sh currently builds the 3 main packages... more work is required.
