        <h1>Two-Color Gradient</h1>
        <div class="description">
            This example shows a two-color style with green at lower elevations and brown at higher elevations.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There is one <tt>&lt;Rule&gt;</tt> in one <tt>&lt;FeatureTypeStyle&gt;</tt> for this example, which is the simplest possible situation. All subsequent examples will share this characteristic. Styling of rasters is done via the <tt>&lt;RasterSymbolizer&gt;</tt> tag (<strong>lines 8-13</strong>).</p>

            <p>This example creates a smooth gradient between two colors corresponding to two elevation values. The gradient is created via the <tt>&lt;ColorMap&gt;</tt> on <strong>lines 9-12</strong>. Each entry in the <tt>&lt;ColorMap&gt;</tt> represents one entry or anchor in the gradient. <strong>Line 10</strong> sets the lower value of 70 via the quantity parameter, which is styled a dark green (<tt>#008000</tt>). Line 6 sets the upper value of 256 via the quantity parameter again, which is styled a dark brown (<tt>#663333</tt>). All data values in between these two quantities will be linearly interpolated: a value of 163 (the midpoint between 70 and 256) will be colored as the midpoint between the two colors (in this case approximately <tt>#335717</tt>, a muddy green).</p>
