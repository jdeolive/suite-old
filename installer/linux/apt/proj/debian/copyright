This package was debianized by Peter S Galbraith psg@debian.org on
Sun, 24 Oct 1999 14:13:26 -0400. It is currently maintained by 
the DebianGis team.

The Debian orig.tar.gz files combines:

  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.4.9.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.3.zip

where the second is unzipped in the nad directory before configuring to add
NAD27/NAD83 and NZGD49 datum conversion.

 Proj is a U.S. Government work and is not eligible for U.S. copyright
 protection.  This is free software.

 Here's what Jerry replied when I asked what the license was:

  `The software was developed by the USGS and has no copyright
   nor license.  Do with it what you will.  :-)'

Maintenance of proj has been taken up by Frank Warmerdam <warmerda@home.com>
under the following license:

  All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ.4 package are 
  available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier
  was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently
  this is not a well defined legal term in many countries.  I am placing 
  everything under the following MIT style license because I believe it is
  effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as
  they wish, including making proprietary derivatives. 
  
  Though I have put my own name as copyright holder, I don't mean to imply
  I did the work.  Essentially all work was done by Gerald Evenden.
