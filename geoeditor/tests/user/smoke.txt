Instructions: For each browser being tested, go through each of the following scenarios.  If the test proceeds as expected, continue on to the next; otherwise, please note the actual behavior (and any confusion about the expected behavior) before moving on.

Each scenario is in the form of 1 or more numbered instructions.  Most of these instructions are intended to get the application to a certain state.  Instructions starting with 'Expect: " ask you to verify some state of the application.  Please take special care to check each of the conditions described.  If you are unable to complete any instruction, please report this as an issue.
Prior to each scenario, please refresh the browser page to bring up a clean view of the application (without any popups, measure lines, etc.)

Thanks for testing GeoExplorer!
