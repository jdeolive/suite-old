GeoEditor is a web-based JavaScript application for editing geographic features.  The GeoEditor toolset minimizes the cost of data development and maintenance without sacrificing data integrity.  With this application, you can edit any type of vector data, including attributes, when served through the Web Feature Service (WFS) protocol.

Built upon GeoExt, GeoEditor will eventually merge with the design and composition capabilities of Styler and GeoExplorer.

This guide provides a core overview of GeoEditor.
